A visual card-generation Skill for Chinese content creators (works with any Skill-capable agent) — Xiaohongshu / Rednote 3:4 verticals, WeChat covers, social cards, AI-tool tutorials, screenshot-evidence cards.

It is **intelligence-driven**: your AI agent reads the content, makes the judgment calls, hand-writes a structured `brief.json`, then a deterministic engine renders it to PNG. Understanding belongs to the agent; deterministic rendering + quality gates belong to code. **The AI never free-styles a layout** — given a validated skeleton, its job drops from "design" to "fill in," and output stability jumps.

The point isn't "it can make a card." It's that it **rules out the vast majority of choices that would turn ugly** — type scale, whitespace ratio, contrast thresholds, line-break rules, palette roles, signature image recipes, all baked into code as constants.

## Three visual languages

Each has a one-line soul, not a recolored skin:

- **Still Paper** — distill content into a warm paper note (life / essay / emotion / travel / reading). Warm paper + Song serif + cinnabar + generous whitespace.
- **Signal Proof** — verify content into trustworthy evidence; *the interface is the evidence layer, so the reader believes the process* (tech / AI / data / work). Cream archival paper + electric blue + VERIFIED stamp.
- **Bridge Canvas** — connect content into a cross-platform unified expression (multi-format 3:4 / 1:1 / 16:9). Cinematic full-bleed + letterbox.

**Signature image recipes**: Still Paper warm-ink duotone / Signal electric-blue tri-tone + riso halftone / Bridge teal-gold split-tone + **haze** atmospheric blur — the same real photo gains a consistent, instantly recognizable look — never a generic stock photo.

## Gallery

See more in [`docs/gallery/`](docs/gallery/). Three languages, sharply distinct, instantly recognizable.

## Install

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

Requires Node >= 20.

## Quickstart

```bash
node bin/blcaptain-style.mjs build <brief.json> --out <deck>
# cover imageRequest throws if no image → fetch & backfill first:
node bin/blcaptain-style.mjs image-fetch <urls.json> --out <deck>/assets --brief <brief.json>
node bin/blcaptain-style.mjs render <deck>
```

Multi-platform: set `brief.meta.format` to `square` / `wide` to emit 1:1 / 16:9 from the same content.

## Where images come from

Images aren't forced. The skill follows what you already have, in priority order, and records every source:

1. **Your own photos / screenshots** (first choice) — Signal Proof's screenshot-evidence cards are built for real screenshots.
2. **Free public libraries** — 12 public sources, CC0 / public-domain first, with China-accessible CC0 sources prioritized (no VPN needed).
3. **AI generation** (fallback) — only when the first two have nothing, with style constraints; inherits your agent's own image generation.

The agent derives an `imageRequest` (search terms + source priority + crop / license / safe-zone rules); a cover with no image is blocked rather than faked; `image-fetch` downloads and records `source / sourceUrl / license` into `SOURCES.md`; then the signature duotone / haze treatment is applied. **Verify each image's license before commercial use — `SOURCES.md` records it for you.**


## Non-Negotiables

Negative boundaries = the real expertise. No purple/blue/orange/pink gradients · no centered symmetry · no all-rounded floating cards · no emoji · keep a handmade trace · culture-sourced color. Every page needs one ≥3:1 hero scale-contrast (a title/figure in the ≥80px giant band), the rest recedes. Still Paper keeps ≥40% whitespace. One accent color (~5%); no pure white/black. Image-first: full-bleed photo as the first signal, signature duotone/haze on top. Real photos / screenshots / CC0 first; AI imagery is a fallback only. Never print internal codes / demo data on user cards. **Technical PASS ≠ visual PASS** — human visual review is the final gate.

## Not for

Fan/idol content · pure hard-sell ads · tutorials over 12 screens. A Skill that does everything usually does nothing well.

## License

**Dual-license**: free for personal & open-source use; closed-source / commercial use requires a paid commercial license. The images you generate are always yours to use commercially — only embedding the software itself in a closed/commercial product needs a license. See [LICENSE](LICENSE).
